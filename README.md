# Problem Statement
Following is a Binary Tree structure:
=====================================
```
class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value,left,right):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

Create a method, which takes a root node as input, and Calculate the Sum of all node depths in the Binary Tree. Depth of root node is 0 and it increments at every next level, Every node at same level has same depth.

Create a Python method as follows:
===========================
```
def BinaryTreeNodeDepthSum(root):
    pass
```
Input will be in the form of Json, therefore parse the Json to create a binary tree and add node references to the Binary tree Node
